## Reading 📚

I started reading since 2020, initially I was looking to ways to spend time after quitting social media and deciding to read books was the best desicion I made. I assumed reading is not for everyone but, now I believe everyone should start reading.

1. War of the worlds
2. The subtle art of not giving a Fuck

1. Ego is the enemy
2. Obstacle is the way
3. Born a crime
4. The Immortals of Meluha
